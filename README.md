## 🌍 About Me

I'm a systems engineer (soon-to-be graduate!) based in Cape Town, passionate about distributed systems, peer-to-peer technologies, and creating resilient, scalable solutions for real-world impact. I blend academic computer science foundations with hands-on engineering—spanning frontend JavaScript frameworks, AI design, backend, and embedded/OS knowledge.

Currently, I’m building NewsNet Africa’s digital infrastructure, focusing on decentralized architectures and robust data systems.
